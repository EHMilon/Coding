## There are 15 header file in C :

1. __stdio.h__: This header file stands for standard input-output header. It contains functions like _printf(), scanf(), etc_., which are used for input and output operations.

2. __stdlib.h__: This header file stands for standard library header. It contains functions like _malloc(), free(), exit(), etc_., which are used for dynamic memory allocation, program termination, and other miscellaneous tasks.

3. __math.h__: This header file contains mathematical functions like sin(), cos(), sqrt(), etc.

4. __string.h:__ This header file contains functions like strcpy(), strcat(), strlen(), etc., which are used for string manipulation.

5. __time.h:__ This header file contains functions like time(), localtime(), etc., which are used for date and time manipulation.

6. __ctype.h:__ This header file contains functions like isdigit(), isalpha(), etc., which are used for character classification.

7. __errno.h:__ This header file defines macros for reporting error conditions.

8. __assert.h:__ This header file contains the assert() macro, which is used for debugging purposes.

9. __float.h:__ This header file defines macros for floating-point arithmetic, such as FLT_MAX and DBL_EPSILON.

10. __limits.h:__ This header file defines macros for integer arithmetic, such as INT_MAX and UINT_MAX.

11. __signal.h:__ This header file defines functions for handling signals, which are software interrupts.

12. __setjmp.h:__ This header file defines functions for non-local jumps within a program.

13. __stdarg.h:__ This header file defines functions for variable-length argument lists.

14. __locale.h:__ This header file contains functions for localization and internationalization.

15. __stdbool.h:__ This header file defines the Boolean data type and its values, true and false.
